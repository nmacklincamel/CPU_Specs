CPU Specs
=========
CPU specs tool will be used for looking up a specific cpu and getting 
other pc builds/hardware components to choose from.

Problem 
-------
* I want to easily find the RAM that I can buy that corresponds with specific Intel CPUs. (i.e. i7 4790k)
          *AND* 
* Find *all* AMD/Intel CPUs that take either ddr2, ddr3, or ddr4

Proposed solution
-----------------
* Create tool that either web scrapes certain sites for the CPU(s) entered 
	  *OR*
* Compile data from these websites via a database or a CSV and then scrape other websites for PC builds
